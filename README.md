# Firewall-rule-generator
A script written in python to generate firewall rule
This script prompts the user for the protocol, port, IP address, and action to be included in the firewall rule. It then generates a string representing the firewall rule based on this input and prints it to the console. The script also saves the firewall rule to a file called firewall_rules.txt.

To use the script, simply run it and enter the required information when prompted. The script will generate and save the firewall rule based on your input.
